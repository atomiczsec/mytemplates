info:
  name: Apache HTTP Server 2.4.20-2.4.43 - HTTP/2 Cache-Digest Denial of Service Attack
  author: philippedelteil
  severity: high
  description: Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43. A specially crafted value for the 'Cache-Digest' header in a HTTP/2 request would result in a crash when the server actually tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource afterwards. Configuring the HTTP/2 feature via "H2Push off" will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.
